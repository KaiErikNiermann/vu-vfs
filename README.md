These are my notes for the fall 2025 version of the "Verification for Security" course at VU Amsterdam. I structured them into 3 main parts roughly corresponding to the prerequisites for the respective assignments or more broadly just the sort of 3 major topics covered in the course.

Finally there is a solved exam in the exam folder which includes related cram notes which might be helpful for exam preparation.

## Structure
- `notes-asg1/` - covers Lectures 3 and 4 
- `notes-asg2/` - covers Lectures 5 and 9
- `notes-asg3/` - covers Lectures 10 to 12
- `exam/` - solved exam and cram notes
- `extra/` - additional notes and resources
    - `induction.pdf` - notes on different kinds of induction proofs
    - `monads.pdf` - notes on some of the category theoretic foundations of monads and haskell (incomplete towards the end)
