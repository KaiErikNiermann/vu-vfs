These are my notes for the fall 2025 version of the "Verification for Security" course at VU Amsterdam. I structured them into 3 main parts roughly corresponding to the prerequisites for the respective assignments or more broadly just the sort of 3 major topics covered in the course.

Finally there is a solved exam in the exam folder which includes related cram notes which might be helpful for exam preparation.

## Comments 

- The notes are not guaranteed to be complete or correct. Use them at your own risk.
- There are additional notes on some of the cateogory theoretic foundations of haskell in the notes for assignment 1, though they are not really necessary to understand the assignment.
